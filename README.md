### Hi there, I am Eva

I currently work at Global Witness, where I use data to investigate the impact of the energy and mining industries on the environment and climate change. 

- I did supply chain tracing, analysis of rail freight and shipping data and visualisation for this piece that uncovered how [Russia-mined Nickel enters UK and US markets despite sanctions.](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/sanctions-gap-lets-russian-mined-nickel-flow-to-western-markets/) 

In my work, I use Python, R, Svelte, d3, JavaScript, Google Earth Engine and QGIS. 

You can reach me on BlueSky or LinkedIn.
