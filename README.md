### Hi there, I am Eva

I currently work at Global Witness, where I use data to investigate the impact of the energy and mining industries on the environment and climate change. 

Examples of work I have contributed to:

- I did supply chain tracing, analysis of rail freight and shipping data and visualisation for this piece that uncovered how [Russia-mined Nickel enters UK and US markets despite sanctions.](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/transition-minerals/sanctions-gap-lets-russian-mined-nickel-flow-to-western-markets/)
- I developed this [interactive scrollytelling piece](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/land-and-environmental-defenders/in-numbers-lethal-attacks-against-defenders-since-2012/) using Svelte and d3
- I created visualisations and analysed satellite images for this piece revealing how the [French waste management company Veolia dumped leachate into wastelands in Colombia](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/land-and-environmental-defenders/poisoned-ground/), from which [one image was republished in El País](https://elpais.com/america-colombia/2025-04-02/nueva-alerta-ambiental-en-la-cienaga-de-san-silvestre-eterna-victima-de-la-contaminacion.html)
- I used Python, R and Google Earth Engine for data analysis on this piece examining how [mining permits overlap with protected areas in the Philippines](https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/land-and-environmental-defenders/how-the-militarisation-of-mining-threatens-indigenous-defenders-in-the-philippines/)
- I worked with two designers and a science historian to develop an interactive exhibit showing the history of Boston’s shorelines from 1619 to the present, and future projections due to rising sea levels. I sourced, digitised and mapped historical shoreline data, and built the final piece using Svelte, based on a Figma prototype. [The exhibit launched at the Museum of Science, Boston in April 2024.](https://cyber.harvard.edu/projects/exploring-urban-sustainability-open-city-data)

I use Python, R, Svelte, d3, JavaScript, Observable, Google Earth Engine and QGIS in my work.
